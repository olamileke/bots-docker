### Bots Docker

------------
I have several Telegram bots written in Python ([factsonfactsbot](https://github.com/olamileke/factsonfactsbot "factsonfactsbot"), [newsondemandbot](https://github.com/olamileke/newsondemandbot "newsondemandbot"), [politicalnewsbot](https://github.com/olamileke/politicalnewsbot "politicalnewsbot")) running in production. These bots are deployed on this server and are accessed via an nginx reverse proxy. Any standalone bots I build in the future will also be deployed here.

I also like learning and playing around with new technologies, and typically build applications after I take tutorials/finish reading the documentation of any such new language/framework. One such application like this is [bookble](https://github.com/olamileke/bookble "bookble"). I use this server to deploy and run applications like these.
